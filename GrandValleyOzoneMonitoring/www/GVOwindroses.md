## Wind roses by season

Draft, 2017-07-29

A wind rose is a graphic tool that gives a summary of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location. A wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing <i>from</i> particular directions over a specified period; for this analysis a season of three months. The length of each spoke around the circle is related to the frequency that the wind blows from the spoke direction per unit time. Each concentric circle represents a different frequency, starting from zero at the center to increasing frequencies at the outer circles.
