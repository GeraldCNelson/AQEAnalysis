CDPHE compiled ozone atmospheric concentration data at 10 locations around the Grand Valley.

Each monitor collected ozone concentration data. The monitors also collected one or more of the following&mdash;temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. The list of sites and data collected is below and a map follows the animation. Data collection began on April 1, 2016 at the Pitkin Shelter in downtown Grand Junction. The last set of observations were October 11, 2016 at the Ute site.

- Ozone, temperature, wind speed, and direction&mdash;BangsCanyon, Book Cliffs, Escalante, Highline, Ute
- Ozone and temperature only&mdash;Douglas Pass and Grand Mesa
- Ozone, wind speed and and direction only&mdash;Palisade and Pitkin
- Ozone only&mdash;Whitewater

In the animation below, data from each site, averaged by hour, are presented. Missing observations cause the colored lines to break. In addition to ozone data, the animation includes particulates concentrations (PM 10 and PM 2.5) collected at the Powell Building monitoring site in downtown Grand Junction.
