# Grand Valley 2016 Ozone Monitoring

Draft, 7/29/2017

This website presents independent analysis, undertaken by Gerald C. Nelson, of data collected by state and federal agencies on ozone atmospheric concentrations in several sites around the Grand Valley in 2016. It combines data collected by the U.S. Forest Service and the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE).
It currently has three elements&mdash;wind roses for each site where wind direction and velocity were collected, an animation of the hourly average ozone concentrations for each site (with particulates data collected at the Powell building in downtown Grand Junction), and a map showing locations of the sites where data were collected.

The website, and the results, are currently in development, and these tabs are likely to vary with each visit. Please treat this as work-in-progress. If you find something that seems wrong or is questionable, please email [Gerald Nelson](mailto:nelson.gerald.c@gmail.com).

For a copy of the data set compiled by CDPHE, please email  [Erick Mattson](mailto:erick.mattson@state.co.us) at CDPHE.
